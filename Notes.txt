
Hi guys...

before wednesday meeting , let me clarify some points about the project uploaded at the Github

1- The main class is db.java where we create the objects and call the functions
2- The main method for functional dependency detection is at Depcheck.java
3- The main problem of this project is to find columns with functional dependency.
3NF=> a table is not 3NF if one column has functional dependency with a non-key column.
2NF=> a table is not 2NF if one column has functional dependency with a sub key of a composite key.

In my opinion, we should not be worry about 1NF because relational Databases
created with modern DBMS(es) are in 1NF by default.

The code needs to further completion and more work to support even rare test cases.
 

all comments, ideas and modifications are appreciated.
