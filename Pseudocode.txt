Pseudo code used in project for functional dependency detection between two coloumns

For All Tables in input test file{

For all columns on a table i{

RS= SELECT DISTINCT  Coloumn1  FROM table i
RS2=SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Coloumn1 FROM table i

fori=1 to RS2{


RS3=SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Coloumn2 FROM tablei WHERE  Coloumn1=RS(i))

If RS3=1 then

two coloumn2 have functional dependency with coloumn1

}
}
